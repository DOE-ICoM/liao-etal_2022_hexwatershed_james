## Overview

We analyze the model outputs both quantitatively (statistics) and visually (maps) for different attributes.

## Metrics

|-------|---------|-----------------|-----|
| Surface elevation | Yes | No | Full domain elevation in different cases | 
| Channel elevation | No | Yes | Only in stream cells | 
| Surface slope | Yes | No | Full domain | 
| Channel slope | No | Yes | Only in stream cells | 
| Raparian zone slope | No | Yes | Only in neighboring cells of streams |
| Flow direction | Yes | No | Full domain | 
| Distance to outlet | No | Yes | Full domain| 
| Stream segment | Yes | Yes | https://github.com/changliao1025/hexwatershed/issues/9#issuecomment-1220952399 |
