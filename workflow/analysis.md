# Analysis

## Overview

We analyze the model output both quantitatively (statistics) and visually (maps) for different attributes.

## Metrics


| Attribute | Map| Statistics | Note |
|-------|---------|-----------------|-----|
| Surface elevation | Yes | NaN | Hydrology model | 
| Channel elevation | NaN | Yes | Hydrology model | 
| Surface slope | Yes | NaN | Hydrology model | 
| Channel slope | NaN | Yes | Hydrology model | 
| Raparian zone slope | NaN | NaN | Hydrology model |
| Flow direction | Yes | NaN | Hydrology model | 
| Distance to outlet | Yes | Yes | Hydrology model | 
| Stream segment | Yes | Yes | https://github.com/changliao1025/hexwatershed/issues/9#issuecomment-1220952399 |
